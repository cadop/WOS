# WOS
Web of Science Python API

These are some useful tools I put together, with inspiration from pieces I could find explaining the WOS API.  I needed to add some loops and error catching to download massive amounts.  I then made a few more tools to save/parse/extract data.

Hopefully it can help some data science or people working on the WOS.

To download data, use the DownloadData.py file.  At the bottom is how it calls for data, with comments explaining what to do with arrays.

If you are interested in helping contribute to make this better, I would be happy to merge commits.
